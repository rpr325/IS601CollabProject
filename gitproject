## Description
**Feature**:  Added definition of the term repository.
**Fix**: Updated definition of repository
**Task**: Uploaded an image screenshot for a repository

[For this project, you need to explain how the usage of Git, Docker, automated testing, and continuous integration can improve the productivity and competitiveness of a company.  Your group also needs to have 2-3 (depending on group size) sections about the selected topics.]

## Guidelines
1.  Use separate pages as necessary, don't mix the sections up, use one or more pages.

2.  The Readme file should show your group member's name

3.  The Readme file should be an index to your other pages and link to them.

4.  Use markdown (Links to an external site.) to style the pages nicely with headings, bullet points, multiple pages linked together. and pictures.

5.  Put a "Changelog" on your readme files that you list all of the changes to the document and who did them. 

6.  Put a section of sources with links to tutorials and feel free to link to other documents in your work.
